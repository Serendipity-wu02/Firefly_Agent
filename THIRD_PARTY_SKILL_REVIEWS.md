# External Skill static reviews

These are engineering license-scope and complete-text compatibility reviews, not legal advice, runtime verification, installation, or activation. The Main-only static table is `src/main/skills/external-reviews.ts`. User confirmation cannot create or bypass a review. Synthetic test entries never appear in this table.

## Review boundary

Review binds the fixed source, full 40-hex commit, canonical repository-relative Skill directory, and SHA-256 of sorted `[path, sha256, decodedBytes]` tuples encoded as compact UTF-8 JSON. Every actual byte is checked against the file's SHA-256, Git blob SHA-1 and decoded size. The exact declared inventory must equal the complete prepared payload. T4 must derive that inventory from the verified complete tree, not a user-selected subset.

All imported files must be inside the selected Skill directory. This MVP has no agreed mapping for importing a required ancestor LICENSE/NOTICE; such a candidate stays blocked pending adaptation. Ancestor text may be evidence of absent conflicts, but applicable required notices cannot be silently omitted. Supported payloads contain SKILL.md, applicable LICENSE/LICENCE/COPYING and NOTICE/COPYRIGHT text, and `.md`/`.txt` files immediately under `references/`. Unsupported files, nested references, binary/non-UTF-8 text, host-only frontmatter, required scripts, host APIs/tools/other Skills, or required remote retrieval block the entire item. No text is stripped, rewritten or executed. Named aesthetic references and explicitly optional capabilities are not required runtime dependencies.

Allowed license IDs are exactly MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause and ISC. Every file needs exact reviewed coverage and an included, byte-verified applicable license with substantive terms. License labels, adjacent boilerplate, package declarations and renderer flags alone are insufficient. The static reviewer must resolve actual scope and all applicable copyright and NOTICE obligations. Content heuristics are additional fail-closed checks, not a substitute for that review.

The [Skill frontmatter](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/683bc88e56f3e09ba94f7055977f3d3aa499f202/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md) explicitly directs to the adjacent [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/683bc88e56f3e09ba94f7055977f3d3aa499f202/skills/frontend-design/LICENSE.txt), containing Apache License 2.0 sections 1–9. Scope is these two files only, not the entire repository/plugin. Both original files must be preserved byte-for-byte. There is no explicit copyright statement in this payload; none is invented from another Skill.

The pinned complete recursive tree and fresh pinned directory evidence show exactly these two ordinary files, no scripts, assets, links, nested paths, references or local NOTICE. Fresh root and `skills/` listings contain no ancestor LICENSE. The [README](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/683bc88e56f3e09ba94f7055977f3d3aa499f202/README.md) describes open-source Apache examples separately from the source-available document Skills; it is context, not the sole license proof. The [root THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/683bc88e56f3e09ba94f7055977f3d3aa499f202/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) lists imageio, imageio-ffmpeg, FFmpeg, Pillow and fonts. None of those components is included or required by the two-file design guidance; no applicable component NOTICE was identified. The complete root notice remains part of the external review evidence.

The body is textual design guidance. It does not require retrieving the named book The Elements of Typographic Style. Memory, screenshots and note space are conditional capabilities. Writing frontend code is the downstream user task, not an import-time bundled dependency. Model adherence, actual host runtime, frontend tooling and output quality were not tested. Host safety and instruction precedence still apply.

This review rechecked preserved connected-GitHub evidence, exact decoded bytes, SHA-256, Git blob hashes, complete pinned directory/tree, and ancestor licensing context. It made no new network request and ran no upstream content. Expanded payload, newly applicable NOTICE, changed content, changed commit or a new required capability needs a fresh review.

## Blocked: brand-guidelines

[skills/brand-guidelines](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/683bc88e56f3e09ba94f7055977f3d3aa499f202/skills/brand-guidelines) at the same pinned commit is a complete two-file payload (`SKILL.md`, `LICENSE.txt`). Its frontmatter points to the adjacent Apache-2.0 terms; the scope is this directory, not all Anthropic Skills. This is not added to the static table: the body says color application is via `python-pptx`'s RGBColor class, an unsupported required library/tool capability. Its Poppins/Lora typography is explicitly conditional with Arial/Georgia fallback, so font names alone are not classified as a mandatory download. Any potentially applicable font notice and runtime adaptation must be resolved before approval; no dependency is installed and no text is silently removed. Static conclusion: BLOCKED / DEPENDENCY_BLOCKED, with runtime compatibility and notice scope unresolved.

The pinned complete tree and preserved bytes were checked for both files: `skills/brand-guidelines/SKILL.md` is 2235 bytes, SHA-256 `1120b3769e2985cefb3d25be981b1f914abeba57ae079b83c20c666c164fa9fe`, Git blob `47c72c607bdb5dd81bdea5de2b5e4f3992a5fd59`; `skills/brand-guidelines/LICENSE.txt` is 11345 bytes, SHA-256 `bc6b3af2f331cbc7fb0da1344efb2cbe5877a31498b4d70dbc7000f3405a1362`, Git blob `4f881c52d1f72f4cfb720e339e2d35c3058d01a9`. These hashes are review evidence, not an approved allowlist entry.

## Blocked: OpenAI candidates

No OpenAI Skill is currently approved. A source may have zero importable entries while remaining browsable.

[chatgpt-app-submission](https://github.com/openai/plugins/tree/5fd93af4cd0c623e020d0cc7e9ce178b4ac1f70f/plugins/openai-developers/skills/chatgpt-app-submission) has a complete two-file text payload at commit `5fd93af4cd0c623e020d0cc7e9ce178b4ac1f70f`, but the adjacent Apache terms do not resolve the parent [plugin manifest's Proprietary declaration](https://github.com/openai/plugins/blob/5fd93af4cd0c623e020d0cc7e9ce178b4ac1f70f/plugins/openai-developers/.codex-plugin/plugin.json). No explicit skill licensing declaration or repository-root license clarifies that scope. Static conclusion: BLOCKED / LICENSE_BLOCKED. The submission-inspection instructions do not themselves require the surrounding connector; no fictitious connector blocker is substituted for the actual license ambiguity.

`build-chatgpt-app` remains unreviewed/blocked: no exact complete-payload, affirmative license-scope and supported-host review is recorded. Surrounding package licensing or connector access is not inferred to grant approval. No installable OpenAI example is forced.
